### About Zerocamp

> Bootcamps are short-term, intensive training programs that provide students with practical and job-ready technical skills

**Zerocamp** is a fully free and open, online coding bootcamp.

ZeroCamp aims to help beginners launch their careers in the tech industry (no prior tech or coding experience needed). The boot camp provides a structured curriculum with weekly topics for learning, allowing students to choose their own resources/use recommended learning resources suggested by mentors. Each week, mentors conduct reviews and mock interviews to test students' understanding and progress. Students receive guidance to develop personal projects and build a portfolio as part of the curriculum.

Here are some of the highlights of ZeroCamp for Students:
- Free education: ZeroCamp is a free and volunteer-run program without mandating anything in return from the students.
- Mentorship: Students will have weekly calls with mentors to assess their progress and identify gaps in learning.
- Job readiness preparation: You will learn the skills you need to succeed in a tech job, including how to write a resume, ace a job interview, etc.
- Community: You will be part of a community of like-minded individuals who are all passionate about learning to code.
- Open startup philosophy: We plan to run Zerocamp following the [Open startup](https://baremetrics.com/open-startups) philosophy. The entire program and its operations will be made open so that anyone can adapt or replicate Zerocamp.
